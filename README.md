# Graph Visualization and Excel Export

This Python code generates different types of graphs and saves them in an Excel workbook.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- matplotlib
- openpyxl

## Getting Started

1. Install the required dependencies:

   ```shell
   pip install pandas matplotlib openpyxl

    Replace the sample data with your own normalized data in the Python code.

    Run the Python code:

    shell

    python graph_visualization.py

    The graphs will be generated, and an Excel workbook named "output.xlsx" will be created.

Graph Types

    Bar Chart: Donation amount and constituent count for different categories.
    Pie Chart: Distribution of donation sources.
    Line Chart: Donation trend over categories.

Customization

    Modify the data in the data dictionary to reflect your own normalized data.
    Adjust the graph types, configurations, and layouts in the Python code as needed.

Output

The generated graphs are saved in the Excel workbook on Sheet2.
